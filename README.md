# Kaggle_KDD_UnsupervisedAnomalyDetection

This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 
The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. 
The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, andgood'' normal connections

DataSet: 
We will use the KDDCUP 1999 data set, which contains an extensive amount of data representing a wide variety of intrusion attacks. 
In particular, we will focus on all data entries that involve an HTTP attack.
